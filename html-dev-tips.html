      <h2>Fantasy</h2>
      
      <p>Fantasy is a genre with lots of magic and supernatural occurences</p>

      <h3>Here's a famous fantasy poem</h3>

      <blockquote>
      All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
      Not all those who wander are lost;<br>
      The old that is strong does not wither,<br>
      Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br>
      From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
      A light from the shadows shall spring;<br>
      Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
      The crownless again shall be king.</blockquote>

      <p>Here is a list of some of the basic things a writer needs to be good at to write fantasy</p>
